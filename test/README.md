here is a link if you want to compile straight from typescript in the future

[karma/typescript](https://github.com/monounity/karma-typescript)

could not get that to work, so the plan is to compile using tsc and after grunt test while

using browserify to give karma tests the require keyword.

kk going back to the typescript route

[stackoverflow for typescript karma/jasmine](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33935523/code-coverage-for-typescript-using-karma-jasmine-and-istanbul)
